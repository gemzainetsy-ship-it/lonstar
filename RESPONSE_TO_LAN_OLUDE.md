---

Hi Lan,

I sincerely apologize for the confusion and frustration you've experienced. I've personally reviewed your account and **immediately fixed the issue**. Here's what happened and what I've done:

## What Went Wrong

When you initially applied through Indeed, our system created your account using your Indeed email (`lanoludecbw2r_8pt@indeedemail.com`). Later, when we tried to migrate you to your personal email (`oludelan@yahoo.com`), there was a technical mismatch that prevented you from logging in. This created a frustrating loop where you received payment setup emails but couldn't access your account.

## What I've Fixed (Just Now)

✅ **Migrated your account** from Indeed email to your personal email (`oludelan@yahoo.com`)  
✅ **Consolidated duplicate profiles** - you now have one clean account  
✅ **Updated authentication** - you can now log in with `oludelan@yahoo.com`  
✅ **Stopped the email flood** - no more redundant payment setup reminders  
✅ **Verified tutor permissions** - all roles and access are correctly configured

## Next Steps - You're Ready to Go!

1. **Visit the portal:** https://lonestarteachers.com/auth

2. **Log in with your personal email:**
   - Email: `oludelan@yahoo.com`
   - If you haven't set a password yet, click "Forgot Password" to create one
   - You'll receive a password reset link at your Yahoo email

3. **Complete payment setup (5 minutes):**
   - Once logged in, go to the "Payments" tab
   - Click "Complete Payment Setup"
   - You'll be guided through Stripe Connect (bank details + tax info)
   - Set your hourly rate ($20-$50/hour)
   - Accept platform terms (you keep 85%, we take 15%)

4. **Start teaching!** Once payment setup is complete, you can:
   - Accept session bookings
   - Set your availability
   - Start earning with weekly automated payouts

## Why This Matters

Without completing payment setup, you cannot receive any payments. This is the final step to activate your account fully. It only takes 5 minutes, and you'll be all set!

## If You Have ANY Issues

If you run into **any** problems logging in or during payment setup:
1. Reply to this email immediately
2. Or text/call: [your support number]
3. I will personally assist you - no automated responses

I take full responsibility for this technical issue. It should never have happened, and we've now implemented safeguards to prevent it from affecting other tutors.

Thank you for your patience, and I look forward to having you as part of the Lone Star Teachers community!
